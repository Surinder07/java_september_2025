## Recap 

Strings 
1. Literal      2. new keyword[object ]


Garbage Collector 
Memory Management in Strings - Heap and Stack
String constant pool

stack            Heap 
String s1 ---->         "abc";
s2          ----> 
immutable 

char[] ch = {'p','r','a','g'};
String s = new String(ch);


## Strings
immutable 



### Mutable Strings 
## StringBuffer 

A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters.
A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified.

1.0 version 
thread safe 
slower execution 

## StringBuilder 

1.5 version 

non thread safe

## String vs StringBuffer vs StringBuilder [interview] 


## StringBuffer vs StringBuilder [perfomance comparison]

String is thread safe

pillars 
1. Inheritance 



when a class inherit properties of the previous class 

Person 
    |
Employee , id, name, email, salary
    |
Manager   id, name, email, salary



when we inherit something 

Parents

Children

  |  
Iphone 17  [AI calling feature ]


Cars

Honda civic 2

2. Polymorphism

something with multiple forms

static polymorphism  - method overloading 
dynamic polymorphim  - method overriding 


Data HIDING 
3. Encapsulation

combinging methods and properties into single unit 

getters/setters

4. Abstraction 

abstract - overview /idea 

hiding complex details from user.
only showing the essential details to the user


## Inheritance 


1. Single inheritance

2. Multi level inheritance

3. Hierarchical 

    A
