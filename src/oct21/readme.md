## Recap 

### encapsulation 
concept of OOP to wrap the data into single unit
data members and functions 
and we restrict direct to the data 

so the access can be controlled by us. 

getters/setters 

### abstraction 

hiding complex details from the user and showing what is necessary 
not showing the internal implementation of an object 

how to achieve abstraction ? 
1. abstract class 

we do not provide the implementation 
it can be instantiated, i.e you cannot create object of abstract class
