## Recap 

### abstract classes ? 

objects cannot be created for abstract class
all the abstract methods must be implemented in the child class

abstract class Test {
it contains abstract method, which may or may not present 
class must be abstract if it has a abstract method 

}


## interfaces?

1. all variables must be 
public static final 
2. all methods must be 
public and abstract

can we have a constructor in interface
