## Assignment
1. ArrayList Problems

# Create an ArrayList of integers and find the maximum value.
# Remove all duplicate values from an ArrayList without using Set.
# Given an ArrayList of strings, count how many strings start with letter 'A'.
# Reverse an ArrayList without using built-in reverse method.
# Check if an element exists in the ArrayList and print its index.

2. LinkedList Problems

# Store city names in a LinkedList and add new city at the beginning & end.
# Given a LinkedList of numbers, remove every 2nd element.
# Use LinkedList as a Queue—enqueue and dequeue 5 integers.
# Create a LinkedList of fruits and iterate using Iterator.
# Check if LinkedList contains a specific element and remove it.

3. HashSet Problems

# Add duplicate numbers to a HashSet — show it stores unique values only.
# Find common elements between two HashSets.
# Convert a List to a Set and back to List — show duplicate removal.
# Given a HashSet of names, check if a specific name exists.
# Check the size before and after removing elements.

4. TreeSet Problems

# Add random numbers to a TreeSet and display them — sorted automatically.
# Find first and last elements in a TreeSet.
# Print all elements less than a given number.
# Maintain sorted names in alphabetical order.
# Remove the lowest and highest element (pollFirst, pollLast).
 
5. LinkedHashSet Problems

# Add elements with duplicates and verify insertion order is maintained.
# Convert an array to LinkedHashSet to remove duplicates but keep order.
# Check performance: add/remove operations vs HashSet.
# Iterate and print elements in insertion order.
# Merge 2 LinkedHashSets without losing order.

6. HashMap Problems

# Create a HashMap storing roll number → student name. Retrieve a name using key.
# Count frequency of each character in a string using HashMap.
# Store product → price. Update price of a product.
# Find the key with highest value (e.g., highest marks).
# Iterate HashMap using:

keySet()
values()
entrySet()
